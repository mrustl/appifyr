## Write R Get Apps!

__Have you ever wished that creating an app was as easy as calling a function? Now it is!__

1. Write an R function, 
2. pass it to `appify`, 
3. specify the inputs. 

Done. There is your app!

> How is this different from Shiny?

Appifyr and Shiny approach building apps from two different points of view. 

* When you use Shiny you start with the goal of creating a specific app. You write R code to achieve that goal. 
* When you use Appify you start with R code. You create the app to visualize your function.
